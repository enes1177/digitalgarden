I am writing to apply for the Master's program in Renewable Energy Engineering.
I am a graduate of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
My university was Erciyes University.
I am very interested in renewable energy.
That is why I want to study this program.
In my courses, I focused on power systems.
My final project was very important for me.
I designed a sun-tracking solar panel.
The goal was simple: to get more energy from the sun.
I used a microcontroller and sensors for this project.
The result was very good.
My system produced 25% more energy.
This project taught me about both hardware and software.
My goal for the future is to be an expert on solar power.
I think your university is a great place for my goal.
I know you have good research in this area.
I believe I am a good candidate for your program.
My background is strong and I have practical skills.
I am ready to learn from your professors and I want to help with your projects.
